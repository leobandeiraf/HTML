			How many more times<br>
			Treat me the way you wanna do?<br>
			When I give you all my love<br>
			Please, please be true
		</p>
		<p>
			I'll give you all I've got to give<br>
			Rings, pearls and all<br>
			I've got to get you together baby<br>
			I'm sure, sure you're gonna crawl
		</p>
		<p>
			I was a young man, I couldn't resist<br>
			Started thinking it all over<br>
			Just what I had missed<br>
			Got me a girl and I kissed her<br>
			And then, and then<br>
			Whoops, oh, Lord, well I did it again
		</p>

		<p>
			Now I got ten children of my own<br>
			I got another child on the way that makes eleven<br>
			But I'm in constant heaven<br>
			I know it's all right in my mind<br>
			'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine<br>
			I can't get through to her 'cause it doesn't permit<br>
			But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh, rosie, oh, girl<br>
			Oh, rosie, oh, girl<br>
			Steal away now, steal away<br>
			Steal away, baby, steal away<br>
			Little robert anthony wants to come and play
		</p>
		<p>
			Well they call me the hunter, that's my name<br>
			They call me the hunter<br>
			That’s how I got my fame<br>
			Ain't no need to hide<br>
			Ain't no need to run<br>
			'Cause I've got you in the sights of my gun
		</p>
		<p>
			How many more timesBarrelhouse all night long<br>
			How many more times<br>
			Barrelhouse all night long<br>
			I've got to get to you, baby, baby<br>
			Please, come home
