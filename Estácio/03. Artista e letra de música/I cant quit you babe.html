			I can't quit you baby<br>
			So I'm gonna put you down for awhile<br>
			I said I can't quit you baby<br>
			I guess I gotta put you down for awhile<br>
			Said you messed up my happy home<br>
			Made me mistreat my only child<br>
			Yes sir you did!
		</p>
		<p>
			Said you know I love you baby<br>
			My love for you I could never hide<br>
			Oh, you know I love you baby<br>
			My love for you I could never hide<br>
			Oh when I feel you near me little girl<br>
			I know you are my one desire<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			When you hear me moaning and groaning, baby,<br>
			You know it hurts me deep down inside<br>
			When you hear me moaning and groaning, baby,<br>
			You know it hurts me deep down inside<br>
			Oh, when you hear me, honey, baby,<br>
			You know you're my one desire<br>
			Yes, you are
